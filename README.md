# Machine-learning-demo
Machine learning demo for multiple algorithm

1. All the demos are reslized by python3, numpy and matplotlib. You may download these tools from the official website, which are pretty popular to deal with machine learning problems.
2. Comments in each python file present some references, which may be helpful to learn more about the specific algorithm.
3. We only provide some simple datasets to test the demos. Trying the demos on any other dataset may cost you some time to tune the parameters for specifc dataset.
4. If you have any question, send mail to joeAsir0560@outlook.com.

Have fun! :-)
