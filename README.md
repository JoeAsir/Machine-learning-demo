# Machine-learning-demo
Machine learning demo for multiple algorithm

## Algorithm demo
Multiple algorithm demos are provided, including python files, test data files and figure files.

## Evaluation demo
Some evaluation demos are provided to deal with machine learning evaluation problems.

## Notes
 * All the demos are reslized by python3, numpy, matplotlib,pandas and sklearn. You may download these tools from the official website, which are pretty popular to deal with machine learning problems, or just install anaconda.
 * Comments in each python file present some references, which may be helpful to learn more about the specific algorithm.
 * We only provide some simple datasets to test the demos. Trying the demos on any other dataset may cost you some time to tune the parameters for specifc dataset.
 * If you have any question, submit issues or send mail to joeAsir0560@outlook.com

Have fun!  :-)
